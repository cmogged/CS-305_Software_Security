# CS-305_Software_Security

The project done for this course was a scenario in which we were working for a software company on a code base from the client Artemis Financial. In the scenario, we had to check for vulnerabilities using a Dependency-Check tool. This tool checks for known vulnerabilities within java libraries and reports the type of vulnerability along with mitigation information.

In this course we delved into different types of encryption and hashing functions. In this project a hashing function was used to create a signature for an object using the java library. A basic web server was built which displayed the hash function signature. One of the biggest takeaways from this course for me might have been the understanding of three different encryption tools: a symmetric cipher, an asymmetric cipher, and a hash function. Data can be encrypted and decrypted using a single key. This is called a symmetric cipher and is often used in encrypting personal data. Data can be encrypted with a key and decrypted with a different key. This is called an asymmetric cipher and can be used for a, "difficult to eavesdrop", receiver connection. Data can be encrypted into a state that cannot be decrypted. Usually this is done with a hash function that outputs a string of characters. This can be used to store passwords in which a password can be verified without knowledge of the password itself.
